                    Hi Ryz
                </h1>
                <p>So now that 1st sem is over, it feels like I finally have the time to gather my thoughts, to stop overthinking and gain the courage to say this</p>
                <p>Honestly, I’ve really enjoyed all the time we’ve spent together, and I’ve found myself looking forward to our conversations more and more.</p>
                <p>You're captivatingly cute, smart, and down to earth, theres probably a lot more words I could say to describe how amazing you are, but I'm not really the best at self expression, so will you let me be by your side so I can find the right words to say express how I like you?</p>
                <p>I don't want to pressure you by jumping the gun by suddenly asking for a relationship, I only hope for the opportunity to spend time together and get to know each other as something more than friends</p>
                <p>I don't know what else I should say so that's going to be it, thank you for listening <3</p>
