                    Hi Ryz
                </h1>
                <p>So now that 1st sem is over, it feels like I finally have the time to gather my thoughts and say this</p>
                <p>I like you and I want to let this out in the open, I don't want you to be pressured, just wanted to be honest about how I feel</p>
                <p>You're captivatingly cute, smart, and down to earth and as cliche as it sounds, I always end up thinking about you every night before going to bed</p>
                <p>I don't want to jump the gun by suddenly asking for a relationship, I only hope for the opportunity to spend time together and get to know each other as something more than friends</p>
                <p>I don't know what else I should say so that's going to be it, thank you for listening <3</p>
                <p><small>PS: sorry na end ang streak, I got busy writing this :(</small></p>
